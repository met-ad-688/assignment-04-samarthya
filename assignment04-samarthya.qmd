# Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis for salary prediction using the Lightcast job postings dataset. Using PySpark for distributed data processing, we implemented and evaluated three regression models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest. The analysis processed 49,352 valid job records with engineered features and hierarchical median imputation for missing salary data.

**Key Findings:**

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor (R² = 0.1789, RMSE = $35,144)
- **Primary Predictor**: Years of experience accounts for 58.7% of model importance
- **Business Impact**: Average prediction error of ±$26,316 (22.8% of mean salary)
- **Data Insights**: Systematic underprediction observed across all models

# Introduction and Objectives

## Problem Statement

In today's competitive job market, accurate salary prediction is crucial for:

- **Job seekers**: Setting realistic salary expectations
- **Employers**: Competitive compensation strategies  
- **HR professionals**: Market benchmarking and budget planning
- **Recruitment platforms**: Enhancing job matching algorithms

## Research Objectives

This analysis aims to:

1. **Develop predictive models** using PySpark for salary estimation from job posting features
2. **Compare model performance** across Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest
3. **Identify key factors** driving salary variations in the job market
4. **Provide actionable insights** for stakeholders in the employment ecosystem

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Lightcast job postings dataset
- **Original Size**: 11.9M rows × 131 columns (684MB)
- **Processed Records**: 49,352 valid salary records after filtering
- **Target Variable**: SALARY_AVG (engineered from salary ranges with median imputation)
- **Features**: 10 selected variables including experience, education, location, and job characteristics

# Methodology and Approach

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

```python
# PySpark configuration for large-scale processing
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("SalaryPredictionAnalysis") \
    .config("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Enhanced CSV parsing for complex data structures  
df = spark.read.csv(data_path, header=True, inferSchema=True, 
                   multiLine=True, escape="\"")
```

**Key Insight**: The dataset required specialized CSV parsing with `multiLine=True` and `escape="\""` options to handle embedded quotes and multi-line content in job descriptions and education fields.

### 2. Target Variable Engineering

A critical innovation was creating a robust target variable:

```python
# SALARY_AVG = (SALARY_FROM + SALARY_TO) / 2 with hierarchical imputation
df_salary = df.withColumn("SALARY_AVG", 
    when((col("SALARY_FROM").isNotNull()) & (col("SALARY_TO").isNotNull()), 
         (col("SALARY_FROM") + col("SALARY_TO")) / 2.0)
    .otherwise(col("SALARY"))
)
```

**Hierarchical Median Imputation Strategy**:
1. **Primary**: Median by CITY_NAME & NAICS6_NAME (11,471 combinations)
2. **Secondary**: Median by CITY_NAME only (2,434 combinations)  
3. **Fallback**: Overall median ($113,472)

**Results**: 40,100 records imputed (100% coverage achieved)

## Feature Selection and Engineering

### Selected Features (10 variables):

**Continuous Variables (3)**:
- `MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE`: Primary experience requirement
- `MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE`: Maximum experience threshold  
- `DURATION`: Job posting duration in days

**Categorical Variables (2)**:
- `EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME`: Full-time, part-time, contract
- `REMOTE_TYPE_NAME`: Remote, hybrid, on-site options

**Additional Features (5)**:
- `EDUCATION_LEVELS_NAME`: Educational requirements
- `STATE_NAME`: Geographic location  
- `IS_INTERNSHIP`: Binary internship indicator
- `COMPANY_IS_STAFFING`: Staffing company flag
- `MIN_EDULEVELS`: Ordinal education level

### Polynomial Feature Creation

Enhanced the linear model with quadratic terms:
```python
# Create polynomial feature for experience
df_featured = df_selected.withColumn("MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE_SQ", 
                                    col("MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE") * col("MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE"))
```

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### Categorical Encoding Pipeline
```python
# StringIndexer → OneHotEncoder → VectorAssembler
pipeline_stages = indexers + encoders + [vector_assembler]
preprocessing_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=pipeline_stages)
```

**Key Insight**: The preprocessing pipeline converted categorical variables into 101-dimensional feature vectors, enabling efficient distributed processing while preserving categorical relationships.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Data Splitting Strategy
- **Training Set**: 39,452 records (79.9%)
- **Test Set**: 9,900 records (20.1%)  
- **Random Seed**: 42 (for reproducibility)

**Justification**: The 80/20 split provides sufficient training data while maintaining a substantial test set for reliable evaluation of model generalization.

# Results and Analysis

## Model Performance Comparison

![Model Performance Comparison](figures/model_performance_comparison.png)

The comprehensive evaluation reveals distinct performance characteristics across the three models:

| Model | RMSE ($) | R² | MAE ($) | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Linear Regression** | 35,801 | 0.1478 | 26,872 | Baseline model with interpretable coefficients |
| **Polynomial Regression** | 35,643 | 0.1554 | 26,692 | 5.08% improvement over linear with quadratic terms |
| **Random Forest** | 35,144 | 0.1789 | 26,316 | **Best overall performance** with ensemble learning |

**Key Insights:**
- **Random Forest** achieved the best performance across all metrics
- **Polynomial features** provided modest but consistent improvements (+5.08% R²)
- **All models** show relatively low R² values (0.15-0.18), indicating substantial unexplained variance
- **Error rates** represent 23-31% of mean salary, suggesting room for improvement

## Feature Importance Analysis

![Feature Importance Analysis](figures/feature_importance.png)

The Random Forest model reveals the relative importance of different factors in salary determination:

**Top 5 Most Important Features:**
1. **MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE** (0.587) - Dominates salary predictions
2. **Feature_22** (0.088) - Likely categorical encoding for specific locations/industries
3. **MIN_EDULEVELS** (0.079) - Education level significance
4. **MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE** (0.045) - Experience range upper bound
5. **Feature_49** (0.038) - Additional categorical feature

**Business Implications:**
- **Experience is paramount**: Minimum years of experience accounts for nearly 60% of the model's decision-making
- **Education matters**: Educational requirements contribute significantly to salary variations
- **Location/Industry effects**: Categorical features (likely representing specific cities or industries) have notable impact
- **Diminishing returns**: Maximum experience requirements have lower importance than minimum requirements

## Linear Regression Coefficient Analysis

The linear model provides interpretable insights into feature relationships:

**Key Coefficients:**
- **MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE**: +$3,608 per year (strong positive impact)
- **MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE**: +$284 per year (moderate positive impact)
- **DURATION**: +$46 per day (longer postings = higher salaries)
- **IS_INTERNSHIP**: -$13,549 (internships pay significantly less)
- **COMPANY_IS_STAFFING**: -$3,816 (staffing companies offer lower compensation)

**Statistical Significance:**
- Model intercept: $92,451 (baseline salary)
- R² = 0.1478 (14.8% variance explained)
- Experience shows strongest statistical significance
